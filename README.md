# Hope for Hostages

On October 7, 2023, over 240 innocent civilians were taken into the Gaza Strip by Hamas after a brutal attack on Israel resulting in the deaths, injuries, and sexual assaults of thousands of people, including children and elderly, women and men. Help us raise awareness for these victims and their families by sharing their stories and photos. We will not rest until they are all home.

This website provides information about the hostages, including their names, ages, nationality, photos, and current status. It also provides stats, allows filtering by various criteria, and generates printable posters and images for online sharing daily.
